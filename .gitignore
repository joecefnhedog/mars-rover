I’ll update this file over time, but for now I just want to put an example gitignore file out here so I don’t have to try to remember which gitignore file I created last.

One final note: Some of those files/directories are unique to SBT, some are for IntelliJ IDEA, others are for Scala/Eclipse, and .DS_Store is Mac-specific. Use whatever you want/need.

Some of this is counter to recommendations, so buyer beware. More info:
